# Golang-Map-Reduce

*This project is an implementation of MIT's 6.824 LAB1 task. A Map Reduce framework. 
(here are the instructions: http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2018/labs/lab-1.html)

*Map Reduce is very important nowadays with technologies like Hadoop for data processing.

ps: Some of the code was already given in the challenge.

ps2: Working with Go (or you can call Golang) is one the best ways to deal with any concurrency.
